create countries{
    make an empty array 
    in a loop, update a variable with the next line of data, add that variable to the array

}
create covidrecords with countries{
    do same as countries with added pcountry being countryArrayList[i] in your loop

}


for continent selection{
    so theyve picked their continent
    then for either of the first 3 options ("totals"){
        for recordArrayList.length
            if recordArrayList[i].getContinent.equals(user inputted continent)
                totalValueHolder += recordArrayList[i].getTotalofthing

        print totalValueHolder
    

    }
