FOR FILE WRITING{
    i assume we are meant to do something like write all the south america countries, north american countries 
    to individual separate files and then when i need to address those countries i just loop through their files
    instead of checking through the og file everytime
}





create countries{
    make an empty array 
    in a loop, update a variable with the next line of data, add that variable to the array
    eventually u have an array full of these countries
}
create covidrecords with countries{
    do same as countries with added pcountry being countryArrayList[i] in your loop

}


for continent selection{
    so theyve picked their continent
    then for either of the first 3 options ("totals"){
        for recordArrayList.length
            if recordArrayList[i].getContinent.equals(user inputted continent)
                totalValueHolder += recordArrayList[i].getTotalofthing

        print totalValueHolder
    

    }
}
